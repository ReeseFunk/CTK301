			<h2>Get To Know Me</h2>
			<p>I specialize in a variety of creative endeavors and have a wide range of skills within the space of creative technologies. As a kid I became infatuated with creating short movies with my friends, and I never stopped. I have been writing, producing, and recording music for over 5 years spanning several genres and sounds. I developed a passion for photoshop and graphic design in middle school and have always been hands-on involved in photography and physical artwork. If I have a vision or an idea that I want to see fleshed out, I find a way to do it to the best potential.</p>
